# SK Lumen

Welcome to SK Lumen, a simple and flexible push notification server perfect for use in websites and PWA's. By using the browser's service worker, you can send native-like notifications even when the website is closed.

Because a simple `README.md` can only do so much, I have also made an documentation platform, [SK Docs](https://platform.stefankruik.com/documentation). If you are serious about using my products, I highly recommend reading the relevant articles. Don't have time for that? Don't hesitate to [reach out](https://platform.stefankruik.com/documentation/read/Doc/Community/Support). I am always open to have a chat and answer questions to your heart's content, unless I am debugging deployment ðŸ˜„.
